	 <h1><u>Advantage</u></h1>
<p>Audio is easier to create. Faster than typing for most human communication needs is talking. That is why we recommend writers brainstorm their first drafts talking them out into a voice recorder such as tinyvox.Audio can also be reviewed by anyone online through new services. The Internet has made audio easy again. Nondisposable audio such as making a tape are valuable because they allow the author to create content without interruption, even for multiperson  purposes. Interruption is the enemy of solo brainstorming, but audio also excels in capturing conversations. Unlike video, audio rarely focuses on the capturing device.

Unlike video communication, audio communication rarely focuses on the capturing device.

Audio communication saves time in creation, it saves time in review. The issue is that audio communication on its own is not searchable and indexable as text is. Other issues emerge such as ease of review, however, and new platforms and information design frameworks for storing and reviewing audio communication emerged readily and can be foreseen as a new way of brainstorming, journaling, communication, idea storage and other key things that have always been done with text communication or not record.

<h2><u>Disadvantage</u></h2>
<p>The sound quality of the MP3 format is not as good as that of the CD , So , CD players provide clearer audio than do MP3 players , Although MP3s can be compressed at a higher bit rate , Most are encoded at 128 kilobits per second , compared with CDs , on which the listener receives sound at 196 kilobits per second , about 50 per cent higher .
The biggest drawback is the low audio quality , MP3 uses the lossy algorithm which deletes the lesser audible music content to reduce the file size , thus compromising on the music quality , Music piracy increased to a greater extent , Cheaper or free duplicate versions of the original music files are available on the Internet for download .
The data is susceptible to losses due to the malware or virus attacks , The people who used the file-sharing service , They had their computers accessed by the hackers , MP3 players are generally more expensive than CD players .
